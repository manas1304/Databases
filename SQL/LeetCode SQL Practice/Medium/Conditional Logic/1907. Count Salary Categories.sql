-- Question:
-- Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:
-- "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
-- "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
-- "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
-- The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

select 'Low Salary' as category, count(*) as accounts_count
from Accounts
where income < 20000

union

select 'Average Salary' as category, count(*) as accounts_count
from Accounts
where income >= 20000 and income <= 50000

union

select 'High Salary' as category, count(*) as accounts_count
from Accounts
where income > 50000;
